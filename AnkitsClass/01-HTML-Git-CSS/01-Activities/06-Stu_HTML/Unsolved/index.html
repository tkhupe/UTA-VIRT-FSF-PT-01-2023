      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello everyone, I am a young man who moved to Texas in 2002 to go 
        to college where I studied for a Bachelors 
        degree in Biology and Education. I later moved to Oklahoma City to 
        study nursing. While there were many barriers in my journey, they made it possible
        for me to do things you only see in myths and legends. Now I would like to see how I can share 
        my journey using this and similar platforms. 
         </p>
